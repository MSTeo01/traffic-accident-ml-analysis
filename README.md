# Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction

## What is it?
- A deep dive into Arkansas's Act 784 (a law that increases the speed limit by 5 miles per hour) using advanced causal inference analysis and differences-in-differences method, revealing a significant 130% increase in traffic accidents.
- A collaborative Random Forest Machine Learning Algorithm we used that would be able to determine specific features that contribute significantly towards traffic accidents delays based on the top five cities that had the most accidents.
